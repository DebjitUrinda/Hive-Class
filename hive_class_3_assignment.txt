1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
  Two steps done to store the file:
  i) Create a directory in neuro lab: hdfs dfs -mkdir /hive_assgn3
  ii) put the sales_order_data.csv in the directory created: hdfs dfs -put sales_order_data.csv /hive_assgn3

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year:
  select sum(sales) as total_sales,year_id as year
  from sales_order_data_orc
  group by year_id;
  
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed:
  select PRODUCTLINE 
  from (select sum(QUANTITYORDERED) as total_ordered, productline 
  from sales_order_data_orc group by productline 
  order by total_ordered desc) tb limit 1;
  
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter:
  select sum(sales) as total_sales,QTR_ID as sales_quarter
  from sales_order_data_orc
  group by QTR_ID;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum:
  select QTR_ID as sales_quarter 
  from (select sum(sales) as total_sales, QTR_ID 
  from sales_order_data_orc group by QTR_ID 
  order by total_sales) tb limit 1;
  
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum:
  

f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city

h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold:
  select a.month,a.year,b.sales as max_sales from(select month_id as month,year_id as year,
  sales from sales_order_data_orc) as a,
  (select year_id as year, max(sales) as sales from sales_order_data_orc
  group by year_id) as b
  where a.year=b.year and a.sales=b.sales;
